# Weather Fetcher

"Weather Fetcher" is a plugin to fetch and insert current weather into the editor of Obsidian.

If you like it or find it useful, please consider give it a [star ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/fyears/weather-fetcher?style=social)](https://github.com/fyears/remotely-save) on GitHub.

## Idea

Initially inspired from [a conversation from Discord](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286238928797736/930637892546609202). A specialized plugin might be useful to those needing writing weather information.

## How to Install

- Use [`BRAT`](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) to install the plugin directly from GitHub repo.
- Or, after the plugin having been submitted to the community list, users can directly search and install this plugin in the community list. (Not yet, as of Jan 2022.)

## Usage

- Install the plugin.
- Go to the settings, and choose one weather provider. (Currently only https://wttr.in is supported. https://openweathermap.org/ is in the plan.)
- Open any file to activate any editor. Then open command palette, then input keyword "weather" to find the command "Insert current weather", click it. Then you should see the weather text written into the editor.
- Optionally, you can click the sidebar ribbon (a "sun") to fetch and insert the weather text.
